    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Start by soaking the dried shrimps in some hot water. Use a small bowl so that you won't end up adding too
            much water. You should be using about a handful of dried shrimps but you can add more if you like.
            Do the same for the mushrooms too if you are using dried ones. You won't have to soak these for long.
            By the time you finish prepping the other ingredients these should be ready to go in the pot!
        </li>
        <li>Peel, wash and dice the taro into a bit chunky cubes.</li>
        <li>
            Heat up some oil in a frying pan and fry the taro on medium heat. Add a sprinkle of salt. Be sure to stir often 
            so that all sides are cooked equally and not burn. Fry for a short time only till you get a good crisp on all sides 
            and the taro becomes fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>Set the fried taro aside on a plate.</li>
        <li>Now add some more oil to the frying pan and fry the rice. Add two table spoons each of both sweet and salty 
            soy sauces and oyster sauce. You also want to fry the rice for a short time only as well.
        </li>
        <li>Now, add the rice, taro and the soaked ingredients (along with the water they are soaked in, there is flavour there) 
            into the rice cooker (if you decided to add the sausage, you should chop it and add it tot he pot now as well) and 
            top up with water. The water should be about 2.5 centimeters  (or about an inch) above the rice level.
        </li>
        <li>Start the rice cooker like you would normally when you cook white rice.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When the rice cooker is done, you can plate and garnish with chopped spring onions and fried shallots to enjoy!</p>
